# 1D SSH model  
It's a matlab code.  
- SSH model
It's a model to describe topological physics phenomena.

This branch has three files now,  
- SSH-电子波函数计算-wavefunction.m  
"wavefunction" is the wavefunction of electron of the whole system.  
The key of this calculation is to calculate the eigenvector of the system's Hamiltonian.  
-- You can change parameter v/w to change the hopping intensity.  
-- you can change pararmeter n to change the number of total cells in this system.
